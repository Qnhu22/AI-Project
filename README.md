MADE BY
Đặng Cửu Dương - Lê Thị Mỹ Dung - Nguyễn Phạm Nhật Trân
1. CATCHING MODE:
You will choose any of the following 4 algorithms (BFS, A Start, Simulated Analing, Backtracking with AC3), then move with the arrow buttons with the task of finding the key and reaching the destination without being caught by the alien bot

THIS IS MY DEMO FOR 4 ALGORITHM TO SOVLE THE MAZE 10x10
